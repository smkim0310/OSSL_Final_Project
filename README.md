### Play Your Color!

>Because we are human, I think every individualâ€™s emotion changes every time. Whether you are joyful or upset or nervous, there are moments when you just feel like listening to the music. But sometimes, it is not easy to find music that matches with your current emotion.

>So, I developed a website that recommends playlists for themes which user selects.

>Each theme, which is shown as colors, represents certain emotions.
So if you select the right color for your current feeling, my website will provide playlist of music that fits well with the feeling that you selected.
